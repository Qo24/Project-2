<!--All the hr tags have been removed from the html file as they didnt have any purpose as I began to use css for styling and actually made my website a bit messier. Also bold tags arent necessary for the headings since the color of the text is white and we wont see much difference so those will be deleted too compared to the previous html file.-->

<!--Details: here i have also decided to replace the info like name birth date and all the text related to this with images that i found on flaticon in order to make the website more responsive. I have also removed the listing tags for the details section and have inserted breaks for each line. I also have not placed icons for date of birth and status due to the fact that the icons which I have managed to find looked unclear and may confuse the viewer.-->
